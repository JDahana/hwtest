            <p>For User interface analysis & research we created a proto persona, based on a student that’s looking for volunteering hours,  conducted interviews, and came up with survey questions based on  volunteering. We created a user flow, where we showed one particular user flow of a user, making a donation. For the storyboard we based it on, our user persona James realized he forgot to finish his volunteering hours for graduation, and was looking for a place to volunteer and his friends introduced him to fridge & family, where he was able to finish his volunteering.</p>

        </div>
        <p>User testing during this phase showed us changes we needed to make across our desktop & mobile prototypes. The major things that were pointed out are: bring down top navigation so its fully viewable, minimizing using social media in different places across the site, less confusing ways to close out drop down menus, and an increase in font size. During our final round of testing, users highlighted their love for the overall color & aesthetic of our redesign. And pointed out some minor changes that would help with the overall flow of the site. <br> <br> We removed a few drop downs from the navigation and also added in necessary information to help users know where to go. And made sure donation options and buttons were consistent across the desktop and mobile version of our site.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Upon initially viewing the website, it was apparent that there were issues with how information was presented and that it might be negatively impacting the organization. Through research, we learned that users always look for the purpose and what the organization does first, & what mattered the most to the organization's stakeholders. This project taught us a lot about the importance of implementing design choices based on what the users need, not what we think the users would like to see. We redesigned the site in a way that integrated the needs of both sides while also keeping the original brand of Fridges & Family. <br> <br> In the future, we would all like to see further expansion of certain portions of the site such as: videos showcasing what volunteers are doing, more information about the owners and their inspiration, highlighted media coverage of their community impact, and of course our design used across their site.</p>
